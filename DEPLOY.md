# 🚀 Ready to Deploy!

I've successfully set up your environment:

1.  **Terraform**: Found in `Downloads` and added to your **PATH**.
2.  **Google Cloud SDK**: Added to your **PATH**.
3.  **Project**: Configured for `smart-incident-reporter-364cd`.

## 🛑 Action Required

**You must restart your terminal now** to pick up the changes to your `PATH` environment variable.

## 🏃 After Restarting:

Run these commands to deploy your Voice of the People pipeline:

```powershell
cd c:\vision
terraform init     # (Should happen automatically, but good to run)
terraform apply
```

Type `yes` when asked, and your system will be live!
